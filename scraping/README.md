# Web Scraping

Stats were scraped from [RealGM.com](https://basketball.realgm.com). 

Note that the code in `utility.py` comes from a class I took 
in 2016 at the University of Chicago. 

To generate the data, run `python crawler.py`

This takes a few hours, so I've done the work locally and saved
the cleaned outputs in the `munging` folder.
